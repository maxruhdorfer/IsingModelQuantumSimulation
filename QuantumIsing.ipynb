    "The Ising model describes spin-spin interactions and was conceived as a model for ferromagnetism in statistical physics. It is one of the simplest, analytically solvable (for $D=1,2$) models which feature phase transitions. The 1D realization which we consider here does not have a thermal phase transition but a quantum phase transition, which we will study here. Quantum phase transition means that for a specific value of the external magnetic field the ground state and thus the magnetization abruptly jumps.\n",
