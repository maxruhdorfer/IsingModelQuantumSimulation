# Quantum Simulation of the 1D Ising Model

The goal of this project is to simulate the 1D Ising Model on a Quatum Computer, i.e. we design a Quantum Circuit which performs a 
quantum simulation of the 1D Ising Hamiltonian and performs a measurement of the magnetization.

This project is still under construction and will be continuously updated.
